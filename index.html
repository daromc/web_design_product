				<h2>Lagoon Legend</h2>
				<p class="history">La Cocha Lagoon is the second largest lagoon in Colombia, in addition to its environmental importance, this place takes us back to ancestral times. 
				Legend has it that this place was the accomplice of a sad love story between Pucura and Tamia.
				</p>
				<p class="history">
				Pucura was the leader of the tribe and Tamia was his wife, they had three beautiful children and were a happy family until Tamia succumbed to the courtship of Munani, a dancer who stole his heart. 
				Pucura decided to flee with her children to the mountains to raise insects, in this way Tamia and her lover showed their love freely for the 7 cities of the area, but the other inhabitants did not accept such a fact, 
				to the point of denying them any service.
				</p>
				<p class="history">
				One day Tamia and Munani tricked a little boy to help them get a cup of water and went to a paddock, there, the lover dropped the cup and all the water was watered, 
				from the cup came a lot of water to the point of starting to drown them, then one of the insects that Pucura raised stung the lover and made Munani begin to expel huge amounts of water through his mouth and nose to flood all 7 cities around him. 
				Pucura, who was in the mountains with her three children, sadly saw the scene. It is said that when Pucura remembers the betrayal and the sad ending, he cries with rays and flashes and his tears make the flow of the lagoon of Cocha increase flooding the populations near the lagoon.
